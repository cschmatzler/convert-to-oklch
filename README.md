# convert-to-oklch

[![npm version][npm-version-img]][npm] [![npm downloads last month][npm-downloads-img]][npm]

Cli tool that converts `rgb()`, `rgba()`, hex and `hsl()` colors to [**oklch()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) in specified css files.

```sh
npx convert-to-oklch ./src/**/*.css
```

```diff
```diff
.header {
- background: rgb(102, 173, 221);
+ background: oklch(72% 0.1 240);
}
```
```

`oklch()` provides better readability since it uses `lightness`, `chroma`, and `hue` components (clother how people think and work with colors) instead of `red`, `blue`, `green`. In contrast with `hsl()`, OKLCH has no issues with contrast and a11y.

Donâ€™t forget to add `postcss-preset-env` to PostCSS to have `oklch()` polyfill.
